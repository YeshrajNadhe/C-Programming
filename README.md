# C-Programming ðŸš€

This repository contains a structured collection of **C programs** written during my **1st year of IT Engineering**. The programs cover fundamental topics such as control statements, arrays, functions, pointers, pattern printing, and basic mini-projects.


## âœ¨ Topics Covered

- âœ… Basic syntax and output
- âœ… If-else, loops, switch-case
- âœ… Arrays and strings
- âœ… Functions and recursion
- âœ… Pointers and memory access
- âœ… Pattern printing (stars, numbers)
- âœ… Mini Projects (Calculator, Grading System, Bank App)
